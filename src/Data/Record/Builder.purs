-- | A `Builder` can be used to `build` a record by incrementally adding
-- | fields in-place, instead of using `insert` and repeatedly generating new
-- | immutable records which need to be garbage collected.
-- |
-- | The `Category` instance for `Builder` can be used to compose builders.
-- |
-- | For example:
-- |
-- | ```purescript
-- | build (insert x 42 >>> insert y "testing") {} :: { x :: Int, y :: String }
-- | ```
newtype Builder a b = Builder (a -> b)

-- | Build a record, starting from some other record.
